# ShopFront

A front end website built using React, CSS and with a JSON server.

# General Info

This is a project built and developed in around 6 weeks by 6 software developers who recently all graduated from Boolean Tech Academy and share a passion to want to continue their learning journey, gain experience working as a team in an agile-scrum setting and challenges themselves. 
The design for ShopFront came from an existing Figma template which we reworked and tweaked. 
The MVP consisted of a Landing Page with HeroBanner, Product carousel, NavBar and Footer as well as a Login/ Register feature and Shopping cart feature.


# Special Features 

Some new areas of learning for us were:

## The language feature using 'react-i18next': 
i18next is a JavaScript i18n framework that manages translations for multilingual apps. It initialises with config, supports dynamic language changes based on the app's state, and targets values in JSON files using a simple function.



## Creating interactive chatbot interfaces using 'react-simple-chatbot':
With this library, we defined chatbot conversations using a straightforward configuration. It allowed us to customize the chatbot's appearance and behavior, making it easy to prompt users, receive responses, and take actions like redirection. "react-simple-chatbot" seamlessly integrated into our React project, enhancing user engagement.
