<h1> ShopFront </h1>

A front end website built using React, CSS and with a JSON server.

# General Info

This is a project built and developed in around 6 weeks by 6 software developers who recently all graduated from Boolean Tech Academy and share a passion to want to continue their learning journey, gain experience working as a team in an agile-scrum setting and challenges themselves.
The design for ShopFront came from an existing Figma template which we reworked and tweaked.
The MVP consisted of a Landing Page with HeroBanner, Product carousel, NavBar and Footer as well as a Login/ Register feature, Shopping cart feature and a Logged In user DashBoard.

# Special Features

Some new areas of learning for us were:

## The language feature using 'react-i18next'

i18next is a JavaScript i18n framework that manages translations for multilingual apps. It initialises with config, supports dynamic language changes based on the app's state, and targets values in JSON files using a simple function.

## Creating interactive chatbot interfaces using 'react-simple-chatbot'

With this library, we defined chatbot conversations using a straightforward configuration. It allowed us to customize the chatbot's appearance and behavior, making it easy to prompt users, receive responses, and take actions like redirection. "react-simple-chatbot" seamlessly integrated into our React project, enhancing user engagement.

# Additional Features

## Login/Register & Newsletter Subscription using 'db.json'

The JSON file "db.json" contains subscription data and registered users, and it serves as an API using the "json-server". To test this feature and the Dashboard you can use the email for testing '<strong>test@test.com</strong>' and the password '<strong>1234</strong>'.
